# Jenkins GitHub Action

Start Jenkins jobs with GitHub actions. Reports back the Jenkins URL and status of the build.

## Usage

You need to setup a Jenkins API token if you require authentication with Jenkins:

1. Log in Jenkins.
2. Click you name (upper-right corner).
3. Click Configure (left-side menu).
4. Use "Add new Token" button to generate a new one then name it.
5. You must copy the token when you generate it as you cannot view the token afterwards.

It's best practice to save the token in [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: jenkins-CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger jenkins job
        uses: joshlk/jenkins-githubaction@master
